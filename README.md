## Environment

Add the following environment variable to your system, for example within `~./bash_aliases`:

```sh
export USER_ID=$(id -u)
export GROUP_ID=$(id -g)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php bash
```

### Urls

* http://localhost:10080
* https://localhost:10443

### DBs

 * jdbc:postgresql://localhost:15432/petstore?user=root&password=root

## Installation

Through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) as [chubbyphp/petstore][40].

```bash
composer create-project chubbyphp/petstore myproject "dev-mezzio"
```

## Setup

```sh
composer setup:dev
```

## Structure

### Collection

Collections are sortable, filterable paginated lists of models.

 * [App\Collection][60]

### Config

Enviroment based configurations, dev, phpunit, prod. Credentials where used fom enviroment variables.

 * [App\Config][70]

### RequestHandler

RequestHandler alias Controller, or Controller actions to be more precise.
There is a directory with generic crud controllers. If you like the idea adapt them for your generic use case, if not drop them.
I highly recommend to not extend them.

 * [App\RequestHandler][80]

### Factory

Factories to create collections, model or whatever you need to be created.

 * [App\Factory][90]

### Mapping

Mappings are used for deserialization, orm, serialization and validation defintions. They are all done in PHP.

 * [App\Mapping][100]

### Model

Models, entities, documents what ever fits your purpose the best.

 * [App\Model][110]

### Repository

Repositories get data from storages like databases, elasticsearch, redis or whereever your models are stored or cached.

 * [App\Repository][120]

### ServiceFactory

Service factories are the glue code of the dependeny injection container.

 * [App\ServiceFactory][130]
